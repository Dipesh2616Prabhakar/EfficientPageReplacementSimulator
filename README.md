# Efficient Page Replacement Simulator
A C++ implementation of FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms.
This project simulates and compares different page replacement strategies to optimize memory management in an operating system.
The goal is to minimize page faults and understand which algorithm is the most efficient.
ðŸš€ **Features:**
âœ… Supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms.
âœ… Calculates total page faults for each method.
âœ… Helps in understanding memory management in OS.
